GitLab CI Pipeline for Dockerized Application
Overview
This project demonstrates the setup of a CI/CD pipeline using GitLab CI for a Dockerized application. The pipeline includes building, testing, and deploying the application to Heroku.

Pipeline Steps
1. Build Docker Image
The pipeline begins with building a Docker image using a Dockerfile. This step ensures that the application is containerized and can run consistently across different environments.

yaml
Code kopieren
build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - docker build -t myapp:$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME .
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - api.tar
2. Test Docker Image
After building the image, the pipeline tests it to verify that the application works as expected within the Docker container.

yaml
Code kopieren
test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - docker run myapp:$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME test_command
3. Load and Tag Docker Image
This step loads the Docker image from the api.tar artifact, tags it with the branch name and commit SHA, and then pushes it to the GitLab registry.

yaml
Code kopieren
tag:
  stage: tag
  script:
    - docker load -i api.tar
    - docker tag myapp:$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME registry.gitlab.com/mygroup/myapp:$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME-$CI_COMMIT_SHA
    - docker push registry.gitlab.com/mygroup/myapp:$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME-$CI_COMMIT_SHA
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - api.tar
4. Deploy to Staging
Deploy the Dockerized application to a Heroku staging environment for further testing.

yaml
Code kopieren
deploy_staging:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - heroku container:push web --app myapp-staging
    - heroku container:release web --app myapp-staging
5. Test Staging Environment
After deployment, the pipeline tests the application in the staging environment to ensure everything is functioning correctly.

yaml
Code kopieren
test_staging:
  stage: test
  script:
    - curl https://myapp-staging.herokuapp.com
6. Deploy to Production
Once the application passes the staging tests, it is deployed to the Heroku production environment.

yaml
Code kopieren
deploy_production:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - heroku container:push web --app myapp-production
    - heroku container:release web --app myapp-production
7. Test Production Environment
Finally, the pipeline tests the production environment to confirm the application is live and operational.

yaml
Code kopieren
test_production:
  stage: test
  script:
    - curl https://myapp-production.herokuapp.com

Conclusion
Throughout this project, I have learned to set up a robust CI/CD pipeline using GitLab CI. The process includes building and testing Docker images, deploying to Heroku, and ensuring that applications are working in both staging and production environments.

What I've Learned
CI/CD Best Practices: Gained a deep understanding of continuous integration and continuous deployment practices.
Docker Proficiency: Improved skills in containerizing applications using Docker.
Heroku Deployments: Learned to deploy applications to Heroku using Docker.
Pipeline Automation: Automated complex workflows, improving efficiency and reducing manual intervention.
These skills are valuable for automating application deployments, ensuring consistent and reliable software delivery, and improving overall DevOps practices.
